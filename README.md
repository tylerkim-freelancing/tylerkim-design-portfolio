### Tyerkim-Design Portfolio Solution

This used to be my freelancing business website which offered pre-made portoflio website templates for artists, freelancers, and students. Clients could explore the templates through the website and customize the colors to make a unique website for them. Once they found a template that they liked, for an affordable price, I helped them hosting the site through `Netlify` for free, and they could always change the contents on their own, since all the contents on a template were populated by the datas from headless CMS, `Contentful` for free as well. In addition, if a client wanted something that none of my template offered, then I could create a fully customized website for him or her, and a template could be a reference for the discussion.
