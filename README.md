### Tyerkim-Design Portfolio Solution

This used to be my freelancing business website which offered pre-made portoflio website templates for artists, freelancers, and students. Clients could explore the templates through the website and customize the colors to make a unique website for them. Once they found a template that they liked, for an affordable price, I helped them hosting the site through `Netlify` for free, and they could always change the contents on their own, since all the contents on a template were populated by the datas from headless CMS, `Contentful` for free as well. In addition, if a client wanted something that none of my template offered, then I could create a fully customized website for him or her, and a template could be a reference for the discussion.

# Templates

`All you gotta do is picking a template you like, and fill it in with your own works! `

I provided completely designed templates which client can modify the contents on their own through headless CMS service, `Contentful`. Advantages were fast production, no hassle, high performance, and SEO optimization for affordable price with no recurring fee. Non-programmer artists often try to create a website on their own through `Wix` or `Squarespace`, and they end up with poorly designed website or putting too much effort and time. Otherwise, they hire a programmer to design fully customized website for them, then it costs too much money. My pre-made templates offered thoughtfully designed website upfront with some room for customization and affordability--the best of the both worlds. The details of the templates are documented [here](https://tylerkim-design-portfolio.vercel.app/documents).
